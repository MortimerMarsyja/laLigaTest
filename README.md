# La Liga test

This project is a small web application that features a React and Redux application written from scratch
most of the state of the application is dealt with almost solely by Redux.

While the application could be improved and will be improved in future versions, 
this is meeting the requirements.

##### Observation:  in the briefing of the test the ReqRes library examples are outdated, so I had to educate myself on the API

# Start
#### Clone the repo from here:

> **clone:**  git@github.com:MortimerMarsyja/laLigaTest.git

## To do

- On following iterations, some layering will be added, with more time , the page would have looked  nicer
- Pagination will also be implemented in the next version
- Memoized version of the selectors to make the loads lighter will be implemented

## Current State

- The application, can log in with credentials provided from the API Req Res
- A user list will be shown
- Users can be accessed, edited their data and deleted

## Improvements
- A back button should be implemented in the User page
- A log out button should be implemented to get out of the page

This two features would greatly improve the UX of the website
