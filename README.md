# La Liga test

## Disclosure

> I updated this repo to be up to my current standards I am aware that the latest changes would not be inside of the deadline.
---

This project is a small web application that features a React and Redux application written from scratch
most of the state of the application is dealt with almost solely by Redux.

While the application could be improved and will be improved in future versions, 
this is meeting the requirements.

##### Observation:  in the briefing of the test the ReqRes library examples are outdated, so I had to educate myself on the API

**_NOTE:_**  A tag has been added to identify the commit that needs to be downloaded that was DUE DEADLINE.
