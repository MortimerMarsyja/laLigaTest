# La Liga test

This project is a small web application that features a React and Redux application written from scratch
most of the state of the application is dealt with almost solely by Redux.

While the application could be improved and will be improved in future versions, 
this is meeting the requirements.

##### Observation:  in the briefing of the test the ReqRes library examples are outdated, so I had to educate myself on the API

## To do

- Add smaller improvements in the UX of the website, for instance a return button from the user profile, and a home button in the logo

- Memoized version of the selectors to make the loads lighter will be implemented

## Current State

- The application, can log in with credentials provided from the API Req Res
- A user list will be shown
- Users can be accessed, edited their data and deleted
- Fully working paginattion was recently included [Out of deadline]

## Improvements
- A back button should be implemented in the User page
- A log out button should be implemented to get out of the page

This two features would greatly improve the UX of the website
