# La Liga test

## Disclosure

> I updated this repo to be up to my current standards I am aware that the latest changes would not be inside of the deadline.
---

This project is a small web application that features a React and Redux application written from scratch
most of the state of the application is dealt with almost solely by Redux.

While the application could be improved and will be improved in future versions, 
this is meeting the requirements.

##### Observation:  in the briefing of the test the ReqRes library examples are outdated, so I had to educate myself on the [API](https://reqres.in/)

**_NOTE:_**  A tag has been added to identify the commit that needs to be downloaded that was **DUE DEADLINE**.

**_NOTE:_** A Valid login user can be found in the same API I linked one article up under **LOGIN-SUCCESSFUL**

## To do

- Memoized version of the selectors to make the loads lighter will be implemented

## Current State

- The application, can log in with credentials provided from the API Req Res
- A user list will be shown
- Users can be accessed, edited their data and deleted
- Fully working paginattion was recently included [Out of deadline]
- Fully working usability cycle

## Improvements
- The only improvement the app could currently have is improving the message to update the inputs 

This two feature would slightly improve the usability of the website
